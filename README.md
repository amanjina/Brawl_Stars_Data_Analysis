# Brawl Stars Data Analysis

### Background:
Since it's initial beta launch in 2017, Brawl Stars has maintained it's status as one of the most popular mobile games in recent years.
Brawl Stars is an online multiplayer game from Supercell, the same company that has created both Clash of Clans and Clash Royale. Players can
choose from a variety of different game modes and brawlers and test their skills against other players internationally in real time.

### Purpose:
As a Brawl Stars player since 2017, I have been curious to know more about the strategies that top players use to maintain their rank
on the leaderboard. Using the [BrawlStats API](https://brawlstats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), I extracted data on the top 200 brawl stars players
to explore these strategies. This project includes:
  * Data extraction/cleaning
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Data Visualization

### Libraries Used:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Plotly
* BrawlStats

*Note: As GitHub only renders Jupyter Notebooks statically, the Plotly graphs in the above file had to be rendered as PNGs. For a rich view of the notebook,
follow these steps:
